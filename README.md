### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Miquel Mar√≠n!

---

I want to be part of the revolution that Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are generating. I consider myself a self-demanding and methodical person in the study. I have critical reasoning and sufficient analytical ability to solve various problems. I enjoy and improve my performance working as a team (teamwork). I believe that perseverance is my best virtue. I do not abandon what I start.
